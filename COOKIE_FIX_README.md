# PropIntel Cookie Fix

We've identified the core issue: **session cookies are not being set in the response**. This is preventing session data from persisting between requests.

## Quick Solution

1. **First, test if cookies work at all:**
   ```
   python cookie_fixed_app.py
   ```
   Visit http://localhost:5000/ to test if login works correctly with the fixed approach.

2. **Apply the direct login patch:**
   - Open your app.py file
   - Replace your login function with the one from direct_login_patch.py
   - Add the set_session_cookie helper function from direct_login_patch.py
   
3. **Make sure these imports are at the top of app.py:**
   ```python
   from flask import make_response
   ```

## What This Fixes

This approach solves the issue by:

1. **Directly setting session cookies in the response**:
   - Using Flask's internal session serializer to create the cookie
   - Explicitly setting the cookie in the response object
   - Controlling cookie parameters (httponly, secure, etc.)

2. **Using consistent data types**:
   - Always storing user_id as a string ('1' instead of 1)
   - Properly handling conversion from string to int for database queries

3. **Ensuring cookie parameters are correct**:
   - Setting proper expiration time
   - Using appropriate security settings

## Common Issues on macOS

macOS has some specific issues with cookies that can cause this problem:

1. **Safari cookie restrictions**: Safari has strict cookie policies
2. **Local development restrictions**: Localhost domains sometimes have cookie issues
3. **Cookie size limits**: macOS browsers may have stricter cookie size limits

The direct cookie setting approach bypasses these issues by using Flask's internal session serializer to properly create and set the cookie.

## Troubleshooting

If you still encounter issues:

1. **Open your browser's developer tools** (F12 or Command+Option+I)
2. **Go to the Application/Storage tab**
3. **Look for cookies for your localhost domain**
4. **Verify the 'session' cookie is being set**
